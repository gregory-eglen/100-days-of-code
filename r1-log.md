### R1D2 [01/13/2020]
Worked on a Trello clone through my boot camp website. Even though I completed the camp, I would like to 100% all the modules on it. Built the front end using JavaScript, then started the rails app version of it which will use the jQuery library to build it out.

## R1D3 [01/14/2020]
Continued working on the Trello clone. Added Ajax requests to the log in and sign up buttons. Watched a good lecture about the event loop by Phillip Roberts. https://youtu.be/8aGhZQkoFbQ


## R1D4 [01/15/2020]
Continued to work on the Trello clone. Added messages for response errors. Set up local storage to handle JSON web tokens for user authentication. Set up default configuration for AJAX requests using $.ajaxSetup method. Learned to inspect network traffic using browser DevTools.
